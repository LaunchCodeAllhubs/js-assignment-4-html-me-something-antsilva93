         <h2>The Early Years</h2>
         <p>
            Super Smash Brothers Melee was released by Nintendo on December 3rd, 2001. Like many video games, it was rushed through to proudction and released way before intended. The game was well received and critically acclaimed, despite all the bugs that came with the hurried release. It's fast-paced aggressive gameplay, paired with a unique playstyle for fighting games, a competitive scene quickly began to grow around the game. The scene was primarily based around playing 1 v 1, and did have a small 2 v 2 scene as well. Some players began to seperate themselves as the best players of Melee; Christopher "Azen" McMullen, Daniel "ChuDat" Rodriquez, Joel "Isai" Alvarado, and Jason "Mew2King" Zimmeran. These players were the dominating force in the early years of Melee, but were all surpassed by a single player: Ken Hoang.

         <h2>The King of Smash</h2>
         <p>
            From the game's release to 2007, Ken was widely considered the best player in the world for Melee. He joined the scene in 2003, with his competitive tag "SephirothKen". For the next few years, Ken was almost unbeatable. He won almost every tournament he entered, and only placed as low as 9th. He also teamed up with Isai for doubles, where they went over 2 years undefeated when teamed up. His dominance earned him the epitath "The King of Smash". Unfortunately, in the late 2000s Melee's competitive scene became stagnant. Major League Gaming dropped melee from it's active roster (Super Smash Brothers Brawl) the next game in the series was released, and Nintendo even banned livestreaming the Smash Brothers line. Ken retired from professional play in 2008, and still is involved in the competitve scene today.

         <h2>The Era of the 5 Gods</h2>
         <p>
            2008 to 2013 is remembered as "The Dark Age" of competitive Smash Brothers. The fanbase was split between games that weren't allowed to be streamed. However, Evolution Championship Series (The largest fighting game tournament, also known as EVO) held a charity drive in 2013 to determine the final game to be added to the roster. The winner? Melee. The fans raised over $94,000 to get their game back in the public eye, and broke the record at the time for largest Melee tournament with 709 entrants; over double the previous record. Despite Nintendo trying to ban its stream, the tournament sparked the revival of Melee, and the scene began to grow larger than ever before. The event was won by Joseph "Mang0" Marquez, with a thrilling losers bracket run where he only dropped one game in his last 3 matches; knocking out Robert "Wobbles" Wright, Juan "Hungrybox" Debiedma, Adam "Armanda" Lingren, Kevin "Dr. PeePee" Nanney, and Mew2King, who had kept with the scene since the early days. Apart from Wobbles, these 5 players rose above the rest. For 5 years, virtually every tournament was won by one of these players. They were resilient to not drop sets to anyone outside of themselves, to the point where taking a set off of them was an acheivement. To this day, only 2 players have beaten all 5 of the Gods in tournament play.

         <p>

         <h2>PPMD</h2>
         <p>
            Previously Dr. PeePee, PPMD is by far the least active of the 5 gods. A Falco and Marth player, PPMD was known for his quality over his quantity. Some questioned his status of Melee God with how little he played compared to most players, however he shined the most against the other Gods. Many of his victories came as going 3-0 or 3-1 in best of 5s. Regardless of how often he played, PPMD never placed lower than 6th in his active years.
