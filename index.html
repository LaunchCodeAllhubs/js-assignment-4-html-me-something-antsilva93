         <h2>The Early Years</h2>
         <p>
            Super Smash Brothers Melee was released by Nintendo on December 3rd, 2001. Like many video games, it was
            rushed through to proudction and released way before intended. The game was well received and critically
            acclaimed, despite all the bugs that came with the hurried release. It's fast-paced aggressive gameplay,
            paired with a unique playstyle for fighting games, a competitive scene quickly began to grow around the
            game. The scene was primarily based around playing 1 v 1, and did have a small 2 v 2 scene as well. Some
            players began to seperate themselves as the best players of Melee; Christopher "Azen" McMullen, Daniel
            "ChuDat" Rodriquez, Joel "Isai" Alvarado, and Jason "Mew2King" Zimmeran. These players were the dominating
            force in the early years of Melee, but were all surpassed by a single player: Ken Hoang.

         <h2>The King of Smash</h2>
         <p>
            From the game's release to 2007, Ken was widely considered the best player in the world for Melee. He joined
            the scene in 2003, with his competitive tag "SephirothKen". For the next few years, Ken was almost
            unbeatable. He won almost every tournament he entered, and only placed as low as 9th. He also teamed up with
            Isai for doubles, where they went over 2 years undefeated when teamed up. His dominance earned him the
            epitath "The King of Smash". Unfortunately, in the late 2000s Melee's competitive scene became stagnant.
            Major League Gaming dropped melee from it's active roster (Super Smash Brothers Brawl) the next game in the
            series was released, and Nintendo even banned livestreaming the Smash Brothers line. Ken retired from
            professional play in 2008, and still is involved in the competitve scene today.

         <h2>The Era of the 5 Gods</h2>
         <p>
            2008 to 2013 is remembered as "The Dark Age" of competitive Smash Brothers. The fanbase was split between
            games that weren't allowed to be streamed. However, Evolution Championship Series (The largest fighting game
            tournament, also known as EVO) held a charity drive in 2013 to determine the final game to be added to the
            roster. The winner? Melee. The fans raised over $94,000 to get their game back in the public eye, and broke
            the record at the time for largest Melee tournament with 709 entrants; over double the previous record.
            Despite Nintendo trying to ban its stream, the tournament sparked the revival of Melee, and the scene began
            to grow larger than ever before. The event was won by Joseph "Mang0" Marquez, with a thrilling losers
            bracket run where he only dropped one game in his last 3 matches; knocking out Robert "Wobbles" Wright, Juan
            "Hungrybox" Debiedma, Adam "Armanda" Lingren, Kevin "Dr. PeePee" Nanney, and Mew2King, who had kept with the
            scene since the early days. Apart from Wobbles, these 5 players rose above the rest. For 5 years, virtually
            every tournament was won by one of these players. They were resilient to not drop sets to anyone outside of
            themselves, to the point where taking a set off of them was an acheivement. To this day, only 2 players have
            beaten all 5 of the Gods in tournament play.

         <h2>ARMADA</h2>
         <p>
            Adam Lingren is a retired player from Sweden. He broke out on the scene as a Peach player, and singlehandly
            got her placed into the high end of the tier list. Nicknamed the "Swedish Sniper" due to his use of Peach's
            Turnips. He won many majors, including an undefeated run from EVO 2015 to DreamHack Winter 2016. He was
            ranked as the world #1 Player for nearly 2 years, and some even claimed Armada to be "The One True God".
            Armada went 7 years without losing a single set to anyone outside of 'the big 6'.

         <h2>HUNGRYBOX</h2>
         <p>
            Hungrybox rose to fame as the best Jigglypuff in the world. His first Major win was Apex 2010, in which he
            defeated Armada. Hungrybox has shown the longest consistency amongst the 5 gods, and is still taking
            tournament wins and high placements to this day. Hungrybox is currently the highest earning Super Smash
            Player of all time.

         <h2>MANG0</h2>
         <p>
            Messi. Jordan. Federer. Mang0. Mang0 is widely considered the Greatest Of All Time as far as Melee goes. An
            active player from 2007-Present, Mang0 has a multitude of major wins over all the players on this list. He
            started off as a Jigglypuff main, and after a brief hiatus in the Dark Age came back to dominate the scene
            once more as Fox and Falco, also known as the "spacies". His name has become synonmous with almost anything
            releated to Melee. Do something good? It's called "The Mang0". Buster out? also "The Mang0". He's currently
            ranked #3 in the world of active players.

         <h2>MEW2KING</h2>
         <p>
            Mew2King is one of the longest standing players of Melee, and the entire series as a whole. Nicknamed "the
            Robot", he rose to the top with his extremely technical and intelligent play style. He was ranked #1 in the
            world in Brawl for years, while maintaining his status as a Melee God. He pushed the frontier of the game
            further than any other player; studying frame data and the technical aspects of the game. Althought he mains
            Sheik and Marth, Mew2King has arguably the largest roster of characters he can play at the highest level.

         <h2>PPMD</h2>
         <p>
            Previously Dr. PeePee, PPMD is by far the least active of the 5 gods. A Falco and Marth player, PPMD was
            known for his quality over his quantity. Some questioned his status of Melee God with how little he played
            compared to most players, however he shined the most against the other Gods. Many of his victories came as
            going 3-0 or 3-1 in best of 5s. Regardless of how often he played, PPMD never placed lower than 6th in his
            active years.

         <h2>The Godslayers</h2>
         <p>
            Over the era of the 5 Gods, other players marked their acheivements when the defeated one in tournament
            play. Many players were able to take down one of the 5 in hard fought sets, only to be swept by the rest
            before the end of the tournament. Over time, the gap between the best and the next grew smaller and smaller.
            Notably, a few players got close. Wobbles, Axe, Westballz, SFAT, ChuDat, and a host of other players all
            claimed victory over three or four of the Gods, but none were able to take them all down. Finally, at Apex
            2015, one player took a set over his 5th and final player - William "Leffen" Hjelte. Two years later, at The Big House 7, Justin "Plup" McGrath defeated Armada to become the second and final player to defeat the 5 Gods.

         <h2>LEFFEN</h2>
         <p>
            Leffen - the Villian of Super Smash Brothers. As he rose to the top levels of play, Leffen
            became both someone to watch. He was considered a player who was aggressive, toxic, having poor
            sportsmanship, and even accused of being a bully. Despite all of this, his talent could not be disregarded.
            He did what many thought to be impossible, and cemented himself in the history of the game. Leffen
            marked the beginning of the end of the Era of the 5 Gods. There were disputes if he were a Melee God, and in the end
            the community dubbed him "The Godslayer".

            <h2>PLUP</h2>
            <p>
               Plup's original claim to fame was "Hungrybox's Teammate", as the two of them teamed up for years in the doubles bracket. Team "Plupbox" has placed consistently high for over a decade. He sat in the tier just below the Big 6 for most of the 5 Gods Era, and in 2017 he rose to their level. He claimed his first major tournament victory at DreamHack Atlanta, and then at The Big House 7 he defeated his last god Armada in winners semis; being the first person to beat Armada outside of the big 6 in seven years.

            <h2>The Chaos Age</h2>
            <p>
               The game was changing, and the community felt the Era of the 5 gods coming to an end. Some say it was Leffen defeated his final God and PPMD had his last major victory in 205, others when Plup claimed his victory over Armada in 2017, others still when Armada and Mew2King retired in 2018. Another common opinion is that while any of the Gods are still active the era is not over. In 2016, PPMD went on an indefinite Hiatus from the game, and in 2018 Armada and Mew2King retired from professional play. HungryBox and Mang0 still play to this day, and many new names are now at the top. The current Era, beginning in 2018, is dubbed "The Chaos Age". The amount of players at the top has grown substancially; with no players dominating in the same way as the Ken or the Big 6. In 2021, the MeleeStats organization released their list of the top 100 players of all time for the game's 20th anniversay of release. With an in depth criteria and a sizeable voting panel, they recognized the players who have paved the way for the competitive play for Super Smash Brothers Melee. Ultimately, this top 10 was their final destination:
