         <h2>The Early Years</h2>
         <p>
            Super Smash Brothers Melee was released by Nintendo on December 3rd, 2001. Like many video games, it was
            rushed through to proudction and released way before intended. The game was well received and critically
            acclaimed, despite all the bugs that came with the hurried release. It's fast-paced aggressive gameplay, paired with a unique playstyle for fighting games, a competitive scene quickly began to grow around the game. The scene was primarily based around playing 1 v 1, and did have a small 2 v 2 scene as well. Some players began to seperate themselves as the best players of Melee; Christopher "Azen" McMullen, Daniel "ChuDat" Rodriquez, Joel "Isai" Alvarado, and Jason "Mew2King" Zimmeran. These players were the dominating force in the early years of Melee, but were all surpassed by a single player: Ken Hoang.

            From the game's release to 2007, Ken was widely considered the best player in the world for Melee. He joined the scene in 2003, with his competitive tag "SephirothKen".
